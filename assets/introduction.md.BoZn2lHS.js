TNESH is carefully designed for creating secure and efficient reusable modules that can be integrated together to create a hApp really quickly.</p><h3 id="existing-modules" tabindex="-1">Existing Modules <a class="header-anchor" href="#existing-modules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Existing Modules&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://darksoil.studio/profiles-zome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">profiles-zome</a></li><li><a href="https://darksoil.studio/linked-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">linked-devices-zome</a></li><li><a href="https://darksoil.studio/file-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">file-storage-zome</a></li><li><a href="https://darksoil.studio/notifications-zome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">notifications-zome</a></li><li><a href="https://darksoil.studio/roles-zome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">roles-zome</a></li></ul><p>Other TNESH modules like mutual-credit, tasks or booking of time slots are being developed.</p><h2 id="distribution" tabindex="-1">Distribution <a class="header-anchor" href="#distribution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Distribution&quot;">​</a></h2><p>p2p apps can also have a hard time with distribution of their code to users in a user friendly way.
