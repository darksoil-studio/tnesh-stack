Do you want the profiles zome to be installed in the DNA you just scaffolded?

Usually you want to include it in the DNA that everyone joins at first when installing the app. You only need to include it in *one* of the DNAs of the hApp.

If you do, scaffold the profiles zome in this DNA by running this command:

  nix run github:darksoil-studio/profiles-zome/main-0.4#scaffold

Note that there are some UI elements from '@darksoil-studio/profiles-zome' already in the UI for this app but they won't work until the profiles zome is scaffolded.
