# Tauri

Tauri is the packaging tool that TNESH uses to create end user p2p apps.

At darksoil studio we developed the [p2p Shipyard](https://darksoil.studio/p2p-shipyard) as the way that we produce and ship p2p apps to both desktop and mobile platforms.

Learn more about it [here](https://darksoil.studio/p2p-shipyard).

> [!WARNING]
> Unlike all other aspects of TNESH, the p2p Shipyard is not yet open source, but rather source available. Learn more about how to contribute to it being open source [here](https://darksoil.studio/p2p-shipyard/license).
